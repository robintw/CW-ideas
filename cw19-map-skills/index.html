(The total amount of text should ideally be between 100-300 words and you can include a diagram or two). The document should be no larger than two pages of A4. Don’t delete the details at the top of the document but you should delete all the hint text once you no longer need it.\nContext / Research Domain Please describe the context or research domain to which the problem applies\nAt present, there is no “roadmap” which makes it easy for learners to understand what topics they should move on to next to improve their skills in the areas of software development and data analysis. Additionally, trainers have no standard framework that lets them tweak their lessons to different fields, by showing what skill topics and proficiency levels might be applicable to that field.\nProblem Description of the problem you are trying to solve\nAlthough many existing initiatives have tried to map out learning progression, many are overly complex with a level of detail that is too confusing for people who do not have a primary background in the space. They often combine general concepts with specific tools and are hard to maintain and keep up to date.\nWhat we would like is a representation of learning pathways/routes, with well-defined “prerequisites”, “learning outcomes” and “postrequisites”, that enables learners to understand what they could or should learn next, and would allow trainers to categorise/tagging their material. It then allows people to understand what are the most used / most useful things to learn in any particular discipline\nThe biggest challenge is understanding what level of detail / granularity the nodes should be at, and how to agree what the links between nodes should be.\nSolution Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified\nDefine a metadata schema for training material (or identify a suitable existing one)\nDefine specific metadata for existing lesson material (including relationship to other existing material, such as “prerequisites”, “learning outcomes” and “postrequisites”)\nDefine representation(s) for the metadata that can show relationships of interest to different types of viewers\nBuild tool(s) that visualize the relationships and the metadata.\nDetermine how to maintain metadata over time.\nSetup a reviewing procedure for the points above using existing github or equivalent frameworks.\n(Very far fetched) build tools that automate the combination of lessons and build new syllabi based on the graph.\nDiagrams / Illustrations You can include one or two diagrams in this section. Please ensure you have the right to use the image(s), and include an attribution if applicable.\nDiscussion below this point Initial ideas proposed:\n Victor: Automatically scraping Carpentries material to create “Lighterweight” material, put it into Jupyter notebooks Jeremy: how do you bring together communities and link that to an understanding of how doing this might help things going forward Neil: How do we help support people who are running events to make their events better, specifically making the events more inclusive - where the support can be done via documents, not via personal support Dan: How could there be more funding for software? Making it easier for people who use open source research software to contribute money Olivia: Using Python to code (add metadata) to data, text, and images in the humanities. Making this more more useful to other subjects.  Discussion\n Dan: How does a new school/department/disciplinary community use existing material produced by others and adapt it / make it relevant with the minimum of effort  Similar to Olivia - by trying to make it easier to apply the techniques developed in one area to another   Jeremy: Roadmap for training  Software and Data Carpentry - where do I go next for each domain   Victor: did follow-up drop-in sessions and surgeries Jeremy: bottom up understanding of software development vs top down (problem focused) Olivia: learnt the techniques that were directly related to the problem to be solved, then where to go next Jeremy: how to signpost where to go next Victor: hard to explain why some programming concepts are useful, without an example  Similar underlying roadmap, with different discipline specific examples   Neil: Skill trees - e.g. learning how to cook - basic skills you need, i.e. learn how to use an oven. Then you could progress towards, say, simple cake making, etc. How would a roadmap work in practice - ensure that they are easy to translate, easy to signpost (can you easily recognise where you are on a roadmap?). Can we ensure these roadmaps are not too expensive to maintain/update? How would you create and design such a roadmap? Does this already exist?  Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages Does this become a directory of training courses?    (A bad example of how to do pathways)\n How would we keep this maintained?  How would we understand how to source the links for what next?  Is this the responsibility of the Prerequisites and (post-requisites / learning outcomes)   Developers of new courses and maintainers of existing courses could be responsible for updating the graph data for their courses, once the idea of a graph is accepted and the initial graph has been created  Use the wikipedia “rules” \u0026 processes to approve/edit the graph data   People would add metadata / tags to their lessons containing learning prerequisites and learning outcomes. These could be treated similarly to current issue / pull request system in place for carpentries lesson development. How do source the common identifiers for these prerequisite and postrequisite “topics” What levels should these topic   Is a tree the best representation for this?  Is it a linked graph?  The level of detail is important - you don’t need the deep level of details C.f. data science skills roadmap, want at the level of text mining, statistics, visualisation     What’s the metadata schema that you need for each “location” on the roadmap?  Relevant Domains Proficiency Level Programming Language Generality of lesson: E.g., general concept, specific tool “High level Topic / pathway”? E.g. Data analysis (or is it data cleaning - what level)? Could use expert judgement or could mine existing materials to identify what people are already using    ","wordCount":"1059","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Katz"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeremy Cohen"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Neil Chue Hong"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Olivia Mitchell"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Victor Koppejan"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw19-map-skills/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Collaborations Workshop Ideas \u0026 Pitches","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/ accesskey=h title="Collaborations Workshop Ideas & Pitches (Alt + H)">Collaborations Workshop Ideas & Pitches</a>
