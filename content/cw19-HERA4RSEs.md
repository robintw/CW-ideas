### **Context / Research Domain**

_RSE Careers_


### **Problem**

_HERA (Higher Education Role Analysis) is a tool which is used to analyse roles found in Higher Education institutions (see [http://www.ecc.ac.uk/about-us/](http://www.ecc.ac.uk/about-us/) for further information). They were written about 15 years ago. While there were subsequent changes to REF procedures, and RSEs did not exist at the point they were written, the descriptions stay the same. As a result, it is not obvious for HR departments how to classify an RSE job. This hinders career paths of RSEs._


### **Solution**

We propose to look through the national job descriptions provided by HERA and suggest updates to include RSE, data scientists and similar roles. Having appropriate job roles is important for recognition and promotion.

The word “software” doesn’t appear in many university’s technical HERA job descriptions. 

We need to raise the issue with trade unions (UCU) as they are responsible for negotiating this with the universities as recognised in the Researchers’ Concordat. The Researchers’ Concordat currently covers academic researchers but is in the process of consultation to start including the gray areas around research. 

For examples of HERA job descriptions see [https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/hr/gradingrewardandconditions/jobfamiliesgenericroledescriptors/](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/hr/gradingrewardandconditions/jobfamiliesgenericroledescriptors/) (St Andrews) and [https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/media/departmental/humanresources/frameworkagreement/technicalcomputeroperatorprofilestco/Technical-&-Computer-Operator-8---EN.pdf](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/media/departmental/humanresources/frameworkagreement/technicalcomputeroperatorprofilestco/Technical-&-Computer-Operator-8---EN.pdf) (Aberystwyth)
