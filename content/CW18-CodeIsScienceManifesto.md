**Context / Research Domain**

All scientific code!

**Problem**

**Science is often computing:** Much of modern science involves code these days, in large part due to the amount of data available - it would be almost impossible to analyse without
computational assistance.

**Science requires peer review:** One of the basic prerequisites for any published scientific
results is that it be reviewed by peers, to ensure the research and conclusions are valid.

**Software contains errors:** We may try pretty hard to write software without bugs, but they definitely still happen - and errors can be hard to spot. The bug doesn’t have to cause [catastrophic and obvious failure](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pogue-5-most-embarrassing-software-bugs-in-history/)[ ](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pogue-5-most-embarrassing-software-bugs-in-history/) - it could be silent but sneaky.

**Solution**

- Write a manifesto
- Create a “sign this manifesto” website infrastructure

**What do we need:**

● People who care about Open Source - don’t have to be coders!
● People who would like to help code the site so people can sign the manifesto
