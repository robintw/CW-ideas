_This document should be used to capture the information for a Collaborative Session / Hack Day Idea. (The total amount of text should ideally be between 100-300 words and you can include a diagram or two). The document should be no larger than two pages of A4. Don’t delete the details at the top of the document but you should delete all the hint text once you no longer need it._


### **Context / Research Domain**

_Please describe the context or research domain to which the problem applies_

PhD students and earlier career researchers are updating their CV.


### **Problem**

_Description of the problem you are trying to solve_

Decide what to call your contribution to a open source software project is hard because roles are not well defined, except for author and maintainers. For example, someone might have contributed to improve the documentation in one project but the role of "technical writer" was never officially defined.


### **Solution**

_Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified_



1. Extend Contributor Roles Taxonomy ([CRediT](https://www.casrai.org/credit.html)), a high-level taxonomy to represent the roles typically played by contributors to scientific scholarly output, to have more meaningful terms related with software contribution. For example: technical writer, database designer, API designer, user interface designer, software developer.
2. whatismycontributorrole.org to give advice to people of what their role in the project is. whatismycontributorrole.org would have as input the link a Git repository and user's name and provide as output the recommendation of how people could list their contribution on their CV.


### **Diagrams / Illustrations**

_You can include one or two diagrams in this section. Please ensure you have the right to use the image(s), and include an attribution if applicable._

Notes:



*   Create really good tombstones for things
*   Do we need guidelines? Can contributor /authorship taxonomies help? (these are highly discipline specific) -> they can at least start a conversation
*   Build a bot!! (the angry librarian) -> open standardised issues on GitHub repos:
    *   You’re missing a citation file -> go here to read some good practice
    *   You’re missing a licence
    *   Create a branch opening “empty” PRs
    *   Have a conversation about authorship!
    *   Twittterbot: “Hey guys - I wanna give you credit. Could you please provide a citation file and a licence and anything else I need to do this properly.”
*   See yesterday’s discussion on crediting contributors [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bec5NVenHSGu2ER3vqJ90Zl4LaepbG7rj-lDe9IK684/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bec5NVenHSGu2ER3vqJ90Zl4LaepbG7rj-lDe9IK684/edit)
