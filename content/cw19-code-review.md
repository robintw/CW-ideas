### **Context / Research Domain**

The peer-review process in academia


### **Problem**

Peer-reviewers are often not code literate, so even if someone writes/uses code in the research and claims to publish it openly and well (with zenodo DOI and CFF file etc), the reviewers (who may be experts in the field) may not have the expertise to check the quality/reproducibility of the code (and the data) 


### **Solution**

A service and a set of guidelines that allows code-literate reviewers to register e.g Orcid ID that advertises to editors that they would be available to conduct a “technical peer-review” of academic papers.
