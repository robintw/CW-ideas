Problem Improving data visualization literacy
Research domain:
Research communication / Data science / Visualization
“Follow the science” has become the tagline for 2020, but what is “the science”? Who defines it and is it really infallible?
We have all seen many graphs and statistical summaries over the last 12 months, many of them not being clear to a lay audience.</description></item><item><title>Online Community Cookie Cutter c&lt;sup>3&lt;/sup></title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-cookie-cutter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-cookie-cutter/</guid><description>CW20 - 2020-03-31 to 2020-04-02 Idea 8 - Online Community Cookie Cutter c3- CI8-CW20

Context / Research Domain Meta-research: the context is a user doing a literature review for any research software project (&amp;lsquo;scientometrics&amp;rsquo;). We’re going to focus our proof-of-concept on speech to text research.
Problem When starting a project on a topic outside current expertise, it can be difficult and time-consuming to ascertain the current state-of-the-art in terms of tools and techniques.</description></item><item><title>Storyboarding Sustainability</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-storyboarding-sustainability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-storyboarding-sustainability/</guid><description>A CW20 - 2020-03-31 to 2020-04-02 Idea 9 - CI9-CW20: Storyboarding Sustainability

Context / Research Domain Many research domains where PIs may not have an awareness of reproducibility and sustainability best practice, may not consider it is relevant to their group or may not know where to start.
Problem PIs are not always aware of the need to consider sustainability from the start of their project.</description></item><item><title>The Turing Way</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-the-turing-way/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-the-turing-way/</guid><description>CW20 - 2020-03-31 to 2020-04-02 Remote Conferences and Collaboration: The Turing Way - CI5-CW20

Context / Research Domain Issues on The Turing Way repository
Due to the current COVID-19 crisis, remote work has become the default mode of working for most people in research, but it has also been common practice for different people and projects before that. How can we, working remotely, maintain the communities in this mode, and make sure that the community and the people involved in it remain healthy, and productive, and have all the information and technical support they need?</description></item><item><title>User centred design principles for research apps / citizen science</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw21-user-centred-design-principles-for-research-apps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw21-user-centred-design-principles-for-research-apps/</guid><description>CW21 - 2021-03-30 Asparagus - CI1-CW21
