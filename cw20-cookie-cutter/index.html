Summary:\n Guiding documents/tools for building, leading and sustaining online research communities sprouted from an event.   Context / Research Domain Please describe the context or research domain to which the problem applies\n In Brief: Support and guidance for online communities working on open research Researchers and research software engineers are rarely trained in community organisation. They may get involved in training and organising events, but they often will learn on the job on the go and rarely have access to support or guidance on current (or best) practices around community organisation. This has been a long term problem for the RSE and other communities. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown has forced many people to work from home and developing and sustaining online communities is ever more important. We want to use the experience and expertise from those activities ignited by COVID and document, to make it easier for future community organisers (researchers or RSEs) to start online communities.  Problem Description of the problem you are trying to solve\nMuch guidance and many resources exist online on how to build communities or organize events. Several are being specifically developed for online communities. However, what is sorely needed is accessible guidance to leading and sustaining online research communities that get formed organically due to online events.\nAs we continue to work from home due to the COVID-19 situation worldwide and suspect that this will continue for a foreseeable future, we have felt a need for such a guidance in our network. This is due to the fact that online events and projects can be organized without the need for expensive resources like venue, catering or travelling. This situation has created a unique and equitable opportunity for anyone with the internet to lead such an event, however many of us need skills to lead and sustain such online projects and people working on them.\nResearchers without any prior experience with project leadership would benefit from a one-stop-shop for guidance or signposts on how to lead their projects and the resulted communities. For example, there have been some efforts to address the need for leadership/management training in the RSE/data science communities (e.g RSE Aspiring Leaders workshop). However, there isn’t yet clear guidance on these topics in general and much of this training is geared towards managing/leading within hierarchical institutional structures rather than within agile cross-institutional teams.\nTo effectively and inclusively lead their projects, we want help volunteer leaders to understand and deploy tasks related to onboarding members, establishing help/guide or mentoring structure for them, rewarding their contributors, offboarding ideas so that people can leave any time (specifically to avoid burnout), reviewing/enforcing Code of Conduct, sustaining infrastructure/services, ensuring data privacy and information on project governance.\n**Solution ** A cookie-cutter-like tool to guide you through creating a community\n Either a “choose your own adventure” style guide to gamify the process An interactive tool (or similar) that takes you through each of the essential steps and provides the user with options and recommendations based on your preferences (like an expanded version of the “Choose a licence” website)  And/or\nA set of documents to capture best practice:\n We could prepare a chapter for the Project Design section of the Turing Way: see https://deploy-preview-977–the-turing-way.netlify.com/project-design.html The text for the chapter could overlap with the content for the interactive tool suggested above a list of organisations (communities of practice) that can support new community organisers on their path  And/or\nMaking an interactive section to the Turing Way using Jupyter Book\nDiagrams / Illustrations\nYou can include one or two diagrams in this section.
