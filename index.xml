Neil Chue Hong - n.chuehong@googlemail.com This document should be used to capture the information for a Hack Day Idea.
Context / Research Domain
Visualisation is important to most researchers, but we often don’t get much training in how to do it well.
Problem
Description of the problem you are trying to solve
Almost all researchers have to visualise data in some way, but in general (like Makefiles and many other things) we tend to learn a few simple examples and stick with them, even if they are not the most effective, efficient or exciting.</description></item><item><title>Code is Science Manifesto</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw18-codeissciencemanifesto/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw18-codeissciencemanifesto/</guid><description>Collaborations Workshop 2018 - 2018-03-26

Participants Jez Cope Philip Grylls Pablo Bernabeu Frances Cooper Tania Allard
Context / Research Domain New university students often do not have the skills expected when they begin their degree courses. One reason for this may be that universities are less able to distinguish between student skills due to grade inflation. Grade inflation is the process whereby exam questions become easier each year, meaning more students achieve higher grades.</description></item><item><title>DUQI (Document Utility and Quality Interrogator)</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw19-duqi-prop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw19-duqi-prop/</guid><description>Collaborations Workshop 2019 (CW19) #CollabW19 2019-04-01 to 2019-04-03 Group 11 - CI3-CW2CC

Context / Research Domain Documentation in general, but especially for software project handover. All research domains.
Problem Quite often, a lot of the detail of how and why a piece of software has been developed the way it did, is hidden inside GitHub Issue and PR discussion threads.
The kind of information that tends to get lost this way are the approaches that didn’t work, since the ones that did have some hope of making it to the final documentation of the package, and they are the code implementation itself.</description></item><item><title>Guidelines for research library users and providers</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw18-guidelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw18-guidelines/</guid><description>Collaborations Workshop 2018 - 2018-03-26 Guidelines for research library users and providers (Group J) Reporter Anastasis Georgoulas - anast.georgoulas@gmail.com

Problem How to find out which research software is developed in an organisation?
Solution Universities are using various information systems to record research outputs, mainly for REF purposes, for example:</description></item><item><title>State of the Art</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-state-of-the-art/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-state-of-the-art/</guid><description>CW20 - 2020-03-31 to 2020-04-02 Idea 1 - CI1-CW20 - ‘State-of-the-Art’

Context / Research Domain Meta-research: the context is a user doing a literature review for any research software project (&amp;lsquo;scientometrics&amp;rsquo;). We’re going to focus our proof-of-concept on speech to text research.
Problem When starting a project on a topic outside current expertise, it can be difficult and time-consuming to ascertain the current state-of-the-art in terms of tools and techniques.</description></item><item><title>Storyboarding Sustainability</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-storyboarding-sustainability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-storyboarding-sustainability/</guid><description>A CW20 - 2020-03-31 to 2020-04-02 Idea 9 - CI9-CW20: Storyboarding Sustainability

Context / Research Domain Many research domains where PIs may not have an awareness of reproducibility and sustainability best practice, may not consider it is relevant to their group or may not know where to start.
Problem PIs are not always aware of the need to consider sustainability from the start of their project.</description></item><item><title>Terminal History Sharing</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/c19-termshare/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/c19-termshare/</guid><description>Collaborations Workshop 2019 (CW19) #CollabW19 2019-04-01 to 2019-04-03 Terminal History Sharing - HP3-CW2CC

Context / Research Domain Training
Problem When running in-person training classes that involve live coding, requiring participants to follow along with what the instructor is doing in a terminal on the screen and replicating that on their own machine, a common complaint is that the terminal input and output winds up scrolling off the top of the screen too soon.</description></item><item><title>The Docutor button</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw19-docutor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw19-docutor/</guid><description>Collaborations Workshop 2019 (CW19) #CollabW19 2019-04-01 to 2019-04-03 The Docutor button - CI18-CW2CC

Context / Research Domain Documentation enhancement
Problem In active projects, it’s very easy for documentation to get out of alignment with or superseded by subsequent code changes. Maintainers of open source projects are hugely overworked and underpaid, so even with the best will in the world, it’s very difficult for the experts who built the code and who wrote the original documentation to review it and catch any of the inconsistencies that appear over time.</description></item><item><title>The Research Data Sandbox</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw19-research-data-sandbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw19-research-data-sandbox/</guid><description>Collaborations Workshop 2019 (CW19) #CollabW19 2019-04-01 to 2019-04-03 Group 2: The Research Data Sandbox - CI7-CW2CC

Context / Research Domain General research data.

Context / Research Domain Issues on The Turing Way repository
Due to the current COVID-19 crisis, remote work has become the default mode of working for most people in research, but it has also been common practice for different people and projects before that. How can we, working remotely, maintain the communities in this mode, and make sure that the community and the people involved in it remain healthy, and productive, and have all the information and technical support they need?</description></item><item><title>Tools to recognise underlying software infrastructure visible and funded</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw21-tools-to-recognise-underlying-software-infrastructure-visible-and-funded/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw21-tools-to-recognise-underlying-software-infrastructure-visible-and-funded/</guid><description>CW21 Hack Day - 2021-03-31 to 2021-04-01 Hermann-1926 - HP11-CW21
