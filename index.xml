Participants Jez Cope Philip Grylls Pablo Bernabeu Frances Cooper Tania Allard
Context / Research Domain New university students often do not have the skills expected when they begin their degree courses. One reason for this may be that universities are less able to distinguish between student skills due to grade inflation. Grade inflation is the process whereby exam questions become easier each year, meaning more students achieve higher grades.</description></item><item><title>Enabling analysis of research software: Creating an enhanced research software corpus</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw21-creating-an-enhanced-research-software-corpus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw21-creating-an-enhanced-research-software-corpus/</guid><description>CW21 Hack Day - 2021-03-31 to 2021-04-01 Batey-1941 - HP2-CW21

Felix - CI6-CW21
Participants Eli Chadwick Iain Barrass Alice Minotto Yo Yehudi Context / Research Domain Planning for continuation of dissemination of research outputs is an established part of a research grant application. We frequently see requests for ongoing costs for website hosting, placement of datasets in repositories or hosting of developed code in an online version control system. However, it is less frequent that considerations are made of ongoing technical staff attention to support staff responsible for code sustainability, maintanence, or data updates.</description></item><item><title>Escape room: Translating between RSEs and Arts &amp; Humanities Researchers</title><link>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw21-escape-room/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw21-escape-room/</guid><description>CW21 Hack Day - 2021-03-31 to 2021-04-01 Cave-Brown-Cave-1916 - HP5-CW21

Due to the current COVID-19 crisis, remote work has become the default mode of working for most people in research, but it has also been common practice for different people and projects before that.
