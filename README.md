# Exploring previous Collaborations Workshop ideas (CW-ideas)
This is the repo for a hack day project from [Collaborations Workshop 2021](http://www.software.ac.uk/cw21) which aims to explore previous ideas from Collaborations Workshops and provide them in an easily browseable and searchable form.

A live version of the website is hosted at [https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/](https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/).

The repo consists of markdown versions of the collaborative ideas and hackday pitches, plus code to host a website to view them.

To contribute to the repository - either by adding new ideas from previous CWs, or to contribute to the code to view the ideas - please see [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This repository is licensed under the MIT license, and all the ideas themselves are CC-BY (this is mentioned at the bottom of each idea).

The team creating this was Mario Antonioletti, Heather Turner and Robin Wilson.

## Building locally
The repository is automatically built and deployed on every push, but if you want to build locally for testing or debugging purposes, follow the instructions below:
1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
2. In the root of the repo, run `hugo server`
3. The site will be built, and served on localhost - see the command-line output for the full URL


## Task split during the hack day
- Heather Turner: The brains behind the idea
- Robin Wilson: The technical guru
- Mario Antonioletti: The plodder with superpowers 

Tasks divided orthogonally
- Conversion of past google doc proposals to markdown (Mario and Robin)
- Configuring and setting up Hugo (Robin and Heather)
- Provisioning a GitHub repo (Robin)
