Way to apply this instead of documentation after the fact? Pitch from SSI fellowship - taking industrial practices to academia  Anastasis: Intended behaviour of software not always known beforehand. Unsure what will work, analyses that will be done, etc. Possible to adapt it to this? At some point you transition from exploratory base to doing things properly. Understanding that transition, test from an earlier stage? How to test notebook Also get situations where code developed for ourselves gets used and adopted by others unexpectedly. Perhaps always assume this will happen - e.g. just always do TDD, or something similar. Ways to write test specs at this transitionary time? Steve: capturing requirements during exploratory phase critical for transition to more mature phase of project; “Just in Time Specification”; there is value in “faking” development/design good practices   Ben: bringing Agile/Lean principles into the process of exploratory research  Jon: Cucumber integration with Jupyter notebooks; specify what the behaviour of that notebook should be, and then actually be able to use this to test the behaviour later on Perhaps also have a linter for checking validity of Cucumber/Notebook descriptions MoSCoW - MH - 60%, SH - 20%, CH - 20%. Perhaps something here to fit behaviour back to requirements? Use BDD markups after the fact (e.g. JIT) to describe behaviour (at the point where you wish to go beyond exploratory development) Behave (Python) package: BDD descriptions in code/notebooks - explore this repository and add to it? https://pypi.org/project/behave/   Add template to a notebook with a pre-populated structure, e.g. start notebook, starts with that templated structure  Context / Research Domain General Research Software Development, and how to capture the behaviour of software\nProblem As sometimes happens in academia, that software you wrote just for yourself or to explore an idea is suddenly useful for others. Often, this means the original software form has to be reimplemented, sometimes quite drastically (e.g. refactoring a Jupyter Notebook, or reimplementing one to standalone Python scripts). What can we do to capture a software\u0026rsquo;s behaviour so it can be tested against if/when it transitions to production, and needs to be refactored/reimplemented?\nSolution Develop a way to apply Behaviour-Driven Development in the context of exploratory research software development:\n How has it been applied elsewhere? When and for what reasons has it been successful? Given that Jupyter Notebooks are a common tool used for such exploratory software development, determine how we can make best use of existing BDD tools in this environment. For example, integration of Gherkin BDD descriptions throughout a notebook to describe its behaviour Develop tool support for BDD within notebooks, e.g. automatic generation of tests based on docstrings that encapsulate BDD in a notebook (using doctest), generation of a skeleton BDD structure within a notebook for filling in behavioural details as the notebook develops  Diagrams / Illustrations You can include one or two diagrams in this section.

Only positive results get published. Common reasons for this are fear that “my code isn’t good enough”, “isn’t complete enough”, “has mistakes in it”. We want to encourage people to share their coding insecurities to help normalise talking about mistakes and knowledge gaps.\nSolution Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified\nGet people to “confess” about coding mistakes they’ve made in the past. This could either be in just to another individual or to a group. It might get run internally at a single institution or as part of a conference or workshop (mini workshop for CW22??).\nThe hack day would work on building a list of instructions on how to run a coding confession. Perhaps making a video or a transcript of an example session.\nTaking some inspiration from the Repro Hack idea we could build a central page (like https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/ ) of resources for running coding confession.\nDiagrams / illustrations You can include diagrams in this section.

The challenge will be to create a combination of guidance and tools to help run events when we have mixed online and in-person interaction, to make sure we don’t introduce new issues? This will apply to most research domains.\nConferencing 1.0 - traditional in-person\nConferencing 1.5 - in-person unconferences\nConferencing 2.0 - online\nConferencing 3.0 - hybrid online, in-person, synchronous and asynchronous. Equality for online and in-person participants\nProblem How will we move offline again? When we have mixed online and in-person, how do we make sure we don’t get issues? Often in video conferences with combined physical and virtual presences, the online audiences are a secondary priority. It’s also much harder to get interactions going with people you don’t know online - this gets harder when in a hybrid mode as video chats are inherently a bit awkward.\nSolution Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified\nA guide for people running events in the future, with pointers to existing materials and tools. The guide would be open for all to contribute to.\nThis would include:\n Templates for different types/formats of meetings and events: help sessions, teaching sessions, closed / limited community workshops, open conferences Repository of useful icebreakers that work Methods to have “virtual” coffee breaks and informal networking. Methods for chatting “Twitch code review” and other sorts of peer-participation Templates for asking/documenting questions and answers. Personas of the different types of participant (everyone is not equal) Lessons learned from other communities, e.g. online gaming broadcasts  It would also ensure that we took and combined the parts of each conferencing paradigm we most liked:\n Conferencing 1.0 (traditional in-person): Coffee breaks Ice breakers Conferencing 1.5 (in-person unconference) Breakout sessions to mix up participants, introduce people to people they haven’t met Lightning talks from all / most participants, rolling a random number generator to select participants to give introductory talks. Conferencing 2.0 (online) Accessibility, open to maximum number of audience, can join remotely. Takes into account travel and care limitations. Virtual chat channels Platforms that make asking questions less intimidating Slack channel for sharing pictures of pets  We would also do a “literature review” to see if:\n Work on this already exists?  E.g. Lessons learned from Mozilla   People already working on this? We should be contributing this elsewhere?  Diagrams / Illustrations You can include one or two diagrams in this section. Please ensure you have the right to use the image(s), and include an attribution if applicable.\nAdditional Notes How is COVID-19 changing the way we’ll be running events and training after lockdown\n Slack vs Twitter: Slack better for chatting, don’t have to think so much about publishing (as it is for Twitter), more like a coffee room chat But you don’t want yet another channel Online there are more distractions Text chat doesn’t interrupt the speaker Asking questions in a document allows better documentation and sharing with everyone Events will become more shareable Can be difficult to understand context, without good notes / good editing, introduce context Easier to deal with “nasty” questions, as audience know that the speaker is seeing questions and comments in real-time Making things public mean that people may be less willing to ask questions / try and fail - how do we prevent this How to allow “outside” participants to participate (Observers vs participants?)  Description of the problem you are trying to solve\n Esther: how to reach out to other researchers, especially when you can’t meet face to face. Thinking about an open consultation hour online.  What you wish to see, how to advertise and prepare   Richard: Trying to support researchers in computing fields. But there is a crisis of computing - tools are getting more complicated, but researcher preparation is getting less and less. Bezaye: How do we impose on researchers to publish every software that is implemented as part of the process of publishing a paper? Emily: Are there good tools and approaches for running a Software Carpentry workshop completely remotely Radovan: Building a prototype (leaflet) map of RSEs and RSE groups where you can share twitter/github/homepage. Issues is that it is working, but e,g, several people at the same place will show up as one. Neil: Been moving things online, what happens when we get out of the current lockdown and people are used to a different way of working? How will we develop events in the future, now that we have this new normal? What kinds of exercises and interaction modes work will online and in person. e.g. the reproducibility exercise, what other kinds of icebreakers  Resources from Carpentries Thread(2020-03-12 [discuss] Is COVID-19 virus demanding alternative software carpentry workshop delivery options?):\n Australian Research Data Commons - ARDC - Virtual Software Carpentry Workshops - key learnings to make it a success (video) Teaching Effectively During Times of Disruption, Stanford Stanford led list of resources of different organisational policies  Carpentries collecting more info:\n Quick Tips for Teaching and Learning Online by The Carpentries Community - GitHub Tips for Teaching and Learning Online by The Carpentries Community - Google Doc Greg Wilson: online teaching Q\u0026amp;A  Code Refinery manuals\n https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/online-training.md Run both events and help sessions Help sessions used to be people bringing laptops to get setup Now have a Zoom meeting, where participants are put into breakout rooms one to one Ensure that people know they are in a queue and they will be happy to wait Advertise via local partners, subject librarians, friends \u0026amp; family, e-mail lists  Need to adjust speed of courses - we’ll need to see how this goes in practice.\n Will people be able to follow along with live coding Will exercises take longer Will it be harder to see who’s falling behind?

The code isn\u0026rsquo;t documented or unit tested. Researchers face the problem of using the code in the dark. How can researchers save the legacy code and lower the learning curve for future users?\nSolution The outcome of this hack idea session is a checklist (preferably ordered by importance) which outlines things that can/should be done to help improve the code. This might need to differ for different programming languages or contexts but much will probably be similar. Sub-checklists could be useful covering topics like introducing tests into a large legacy code base, which things should be documented first, etc.\nSome ideas we already came up in our discussion and which could inform the development of such a checklist as as follows:\n Try to (1) install/setup and (2) use legacy code and document successful steps. You can start writing things in the README file and later, when the documentation starts to be too long, you can migrate to another platform and break it into sections.  Depending of the language and dependencies used by your project, is useful to future users to have a Makefile (for examples, projects in C or Fortran) or a Dockerfile (for example, projects in Django or Node.js) as those files reduce repetitive typing from users   Ask or pay someone new to the project to review the steps that you documented (particularly with regards to download/installation/setup). Undergraduate students and earlier stage RSE are great for this task as they might be also new to technologies that you are using. For example, students might be new to Git submodules and report to you that additional instructions are needed. This will also help you identify hardware configurations that need to be documented, for example Docker requires virtualisation enabled. Restructuring/Refactoring/Rewriting code in the original language can be useful:  documentation still to be worked on, but code is now clearer. Restructuring the code (e.g. main project and sub-module) can make sharing easier; Can make translating to other languages easier as you can progress with smaller sections/modules and reduce the risk of breaking with untested original code   Introducing testing is really difficult if you have one large complicated workflow it might be best, if applicable to the code, to start with overall tests that ensure the final result is correct before introducing unit tests for smaller sections Contact your university library and ask if they have a procedure to archive/register software. If they do, they might be able to provide you with additional check (for example, to have a citation file or DOI) and staff time to check your code. The Data Curation Network has created primers to review a range of data and code types that can facilitate that process: https://datacurationnetwork.org/resources/data-curation-primers/ The hackday could create an index of institutions listing the support services available.

Context / Research Domain General RSE audiences, (and really any software developer)\nResearchers who are not RSE - could have general or very specific queries.\nProblem It is a specialist skill to be able to decipher error messages and find answers quickly online. These are skills which are not widely taught (and often under-appreciated), but are critical to being an effective developer. Often these kinds of issues are directed to a specific individual within a group/department/company which is not a good use of time/resources. This is particularly a problem for beginner programmers (who may not know what the relevant parts of their problem are), and for people working outside of software development teams with relevant experts.\nSolution We propose an interactive online course to help people with deciphering error messages, building search queries and finding solutions. We propose to do this via a treasure hunt!\nThe course would start with slides/presentation with_ _basic tips. Then moving on to give examples of errors (for example an error message or stack trace) and asking the students to then try and extract the relevant bits, do the relevant searches and find answers - with some tips along the way. Then follow up with best practice on how ‘the experts’ would have done it.\nThe examples would be carefully chosen so that the answers are definitely ‘out there’ to find, in various places (StackOverflow, blogs, forums, documentation) - and designed to gradually increase in difficulty. We are aware there would need to be considerations for different programming languages, so would suggest starting with a well-known language - Python.\nThe course would be designed to be able to be taken online by an individual alone, or alternatively as a ‘taught course’ in a group - potentially as part of a Software Carpentry course.\nDiagrams / Illustrations Our view of how a “treasure hunt” would work:\n_https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g-CBDLqARbWfo82Dkw9H3REcQ4LE_5mcKmwzZR60Zsc/edit?usp=sharing _\nThe “faded problem” would be that the intermediate steps would gradually be removed as the difficulty increases.\nAnd for those who have felt the pain of searching for solutions online, we give you this inadequate solace:\n(https://xkcd.com/979/ licensed CC BY-NC 2.5)\nThanks for reading!\n(l-r - Matt C, Robin, Dominic; Matt B, Paddy) Licence These materials (unless otherwise specified) are available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Licence.

One reason for this may be that universities are less able to distinguish between student skills due to grade inflation. Grade inflation is the process whereby exam questions become easier each year, meaning more students achieve higher grades. But does grade inflation actually exist?\nProblem  The secondary education system has recently undergone an overhaul of the grading system to combat grade inflation at the top end. This can be attributed to a combination of political and societal pressures for better grades along with changes to the background knowledge that students gain before and outside formal education: there isn’t enough data currently to tease these apart This was also seen at the beginning of the last decade in the introduction of A* to A-levels and has been noted in the grade distributions of undergraduate degrees; this is a particular problem as degree entry requirements often fail to track changes to the underlying pre-university curriculum.  Solution  Include suggested preparations in addition to prerequisites, especially relevant for cases in which a degree will split into very different routes (e.g., Psychology, Linguistics, ..). Could the grade inflation also be tackled through a behavioural approach, in which lecturers and students would receive expert, unified training about the need to have a coherent grade landscape? We suggest using publicly available data to create an interactive dashboard comparing different viewpoints of the problem including average grade distributions, university admission grades, and the ability to sample topics and questions from different years.  Diagrams / Illustrations Notes from the Ideas Session  Idea A: Problems and solutions to the use of tech in public administration \u0026mdash;-\nRelevant questions:\n AI and digital technologies used in the Criminal Justice system.  What is fairness?  Representative sampling Same release rates (ie white vs minority i.e. COMPASS) Same false positive (are we looking for none) Facial recognition and targeting   False negatives / false positives in prison release Boundaries:   Solutions:  How to test data sets and compare their outcomes to the people they affect How to robustly test digital technologies against the best criminological theory    Idea B: Managing digitised content of the British Library. 0++0\nThe British Library (BL) has a vast amount of paper data, some of which has been digitised.\n  Challenges:\n Digitising as much of this content as possible, which has been highlighted with crises such as Covid-19. Even once digitised, making this content available at scale has been a challenge. Funding needed.    Legal deposit: anything published in the UK must be made available to BL, both print and non-print. This includes the UK Web (.co.uk, .ac.uk, \u0026hellip;). This deposit can only be accessed by someone physically located in a Legal Deposit library1 reading room.\n  Solution: Applying firewall policy in BL infrastructure for internal analyses, and publishing results with a secure licence. Redraw relevant law to be able to grant content requests.\n The legal problem can’t be addressed by a hackday (if only!) but technological solutions might be possible to improve access within the current law E.g. DataSHIELD2 extended to do text data mining Idea C: Recurrent phone scams \u0026mdash;+    How and can this go on? Is there not enough tech to tackle it?\n  Massive corps (esp. banks) must surely have the necessary information to prevent and resolve these incidents.\n  System: Simple system of matching information would go some way to prevent these incidents.\n  Is this happening because people are using spreadsheets?\n  Idea D: Limited comp science skills in entry to some degrees +++0\nSolutions:\n Build a kind of guide about prerequisites for getting up to speed with some skills. In the context of the decrease in knowledge over time, at a national level, as forced by a gradual grade inflation, a tool could be created to assess this progression. Information could be shared in a data dashboard, achievable in a hack day. Unis would benefit from this tool. Public stats could be used to create this.  Idea E: Reproducibility in scientific computing +0 +0\n Seen as black and white - whereas the spectrum is more complex. Solution: Create a reproducibility analyser. When a new release is made, content of the repo can be analysed. Automatic report created including environment spec compared to previous release. CodeCoverage: how text is changing, how testing is being done. Useful for group leaders. Barrier of entry to somebody else’s research can be understood. Could be used to create certification as well as personal understanding. Evolving checklist. Consider FAIR data checklist and extend for purpose of reproducibility. Convenient for inclusion of wider community.

Domain registries such as swMath for mathematical software and ASCL.net for astrophysics software which accept author-led suggestions also use these techniques to identify possible candidates for inclusion. Other approaches relied on automatically mining code repositories looking for key markers, such as citation files or DOIs.\nThis year, two datasets have been released which have gone further to produce a “gold standard” corpus that can be used for other research. The SoftCite project is a human curated list of 4,093 software mentions in life sciences and social sciences, as a TEI/XML file: https://github.com/howisonlab/softcite-dataset. This, in turn, was used by a team at CZI to train a machine learning model that has been used to identify software references in COVID-19 research papers, collectively CORD-19, which has been published as a raw dataset: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vmcvdncs0\nWe would like to make this data more useful for those wanting to undertake research in this area.\nSolution Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified\nPotential ways of improving this include:\n Analysing and cleaning the CORD-19 software mentions to create a canonical list of software along with common aliases (e.g. MS Excel, Excel, Microsoft Excel should all be related) Annotating the datasets to provide additional useful metadata such as DOIs, URLs to code repositories where they exist, release dates Creating processes and tools that assist with the above  This could then be used to provide some basic metrics around the research software landscape e.g.\n What is the most popular license for research software? Has this changed through time? Is the most popular software updated more often? How many people contribute code to research software on average? Distribution of usage, contributions, updates → guidance for funding, sustainability of RS Does the set of contributors to research software shift, which could be a marker for reuse? How many software projects provide citation information?  possible look into citation network, contributor network, dependency network (and/or overlap between these)    It could also be used to demonstrate things that we could do with such a corpus\n Demonstrate the state of FAIRness of software, and track the development of FAIRness Use it for testing and benchmarking software engineering methods, e.g., automated program repair, test generation, etc.  And, of course, the big one:\n What software is most important to COVID-19 research?  As suggested by the OSCAR collaborative ideas group, there are many things that could be done to analyse the dataset, to identify statistics or trends that could illustrate issues. These include the key role software has played in responding to COVID-19 (and lack of recognition of its importance), the issues in citation of research software (and possibly findability and accessibility of the software), methods to identify key software infrastructure.\nSome of the questions we could hope to answer are:\n Is information provided about the software authors to give them credit? How many/which pieces of software are repeatedly mentioned (and could possibly be defined as critical research infrastructure)? How was the software mentioned? (e.g. proper references to the software, in-line in the text, footnote, etc.) How was the software itself referenced (e.g. A GitHub page to a project, a GitHub page to a release, a Zenodo DOI to an archive, a Software Heritage link to a release, etc.) What percentage of all articles mention software? How many pieces of software are mentioned per paper? What was the software used for (e.g. platform, analysis) Subdiscipline analysis - is there some smaller set of the dataset (eg a subdiscipline) where the answers to any of these questions differ to that of the whole dataset, that might illuminate where a community is doing things differently/better?

We frequently see requests for ongoing costs for website hosting, placement of datasets in repositories or hosting of developed code in an online version control system. However, it is less frequent that considerations are made of ongoing technical staff attention to support staff responsible for code sustainability, maintanence, or data updates. Code \u0026ldquo;end of project plans\u0026rdquo;, which detail what attention has been paid to issues around what happens to support developed research software at the end of a PhD project or research grant will help to assure those other users of the software of its ongoing sustainability, can be a crucial part of this support. Avoiding the curse of \u0026ldquo;PhD-ware\u0026rdquo; assures PIs within a research group that future work of the group can successfully build on a substantial investment of intellectual effort.\nFor this session we propose development of a project to assure software sustainability when that software comes from a short fixed-term project.\nProblem Two main situations can arise: either the software is not maintained and virtually \u0026ldquo;left to die out\u0026rdquo;, or the original developer keeps maintaining it at the new institution, keeping them away from new duties. In the latter scenario we can still encounter problems tracking down and contacting the developer. Well documented and annotated code is only part of the solution, especially when we consider sizable projects. Currently there is no widely accepted agreement nor policy about whom the responsibility of code maintenance lies with.\nEven when there\u0026rsquo;s a maintenance plan for funding and grants, this generally includes technical costs (e.g. hosting, domain and SSL certificate purchases), but not the time/people needed.\nSolution A short (~5 minutes) questionnaire that leads to a badge for your README indicating your maintenance/end-of-life plans. This should be a minimal amount of work to encourage people to consider maintenance without becoming overwhelmed by the options\nQuestions include:  How much maintenance do you want to do? None/a tiny bit/a lot/etc. Do you have funding for maintenance? Have you identified funding opportunities for further maintenance? How long do you intend to maintain for? Will you continue maintenance after funding runs out? Who is the contact person at the end of the project? Do you expect to ever come back to this project for further development? I.e. is this a development gap, not end-of-life Do you welcome new development from other people? Are you able to answer questions/open to being contacted? Do you support/help track forks for new development?  Diagrams / Illustrations Licence These materials (unless otherwise specified) are available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Licence.

This can make developing research software for them challenging- particularly when A\u0026amp;H problems are often defined in ways that are very different from how computational problems are defined.\nWe want to help researchers in A\u0026amp;H and RSEs to communicate better, so that they can collaborate on building research software more easily.\nUsing gamified versions of boring and dry training materials for software development, we want to make learning about software development fun and accessible.\nSolution Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified\nVirtual escape room: Solve a set of connected puzzles to escape the virtual game room. In the course of solving the puzzles, the participants will learn key concepts from research software development.\nOur pitch: develop the Part 1 of this escape room series:Theme: Gamified activities to learn the meaning of common jargon words. E.g. API, Object, function, Sprint, version, Agile, automation\nThe escape room will be themed around learning to translate an alien language (Software development) expressed in an unusual way, so that the unfamiliar concepts can be understood in the context of our work. For example: which of these flow diagrams is the correct one? What analogy of a RSE concept can we find in humanities?\n Format: Online, can use existing websites or a GitHub repository with questions and clues to find information. Learning journey. **Aim: **The aim is to encourage participants to look for information and find out resources about software development practices and RSE related concepts themselves as they find answers to solve the puzzles. Outcome of the escape room activity: participants are familiar with 4 concepts/jargon words usually used by software developers. Participants are now in a better position to work/interact with Research Software Engineers- or to go on and learn to become digital humanities developers themselves.  Potential topics and set of activities for escape rooms for part 2 onwards (not proposed for this pitch, but idea for future collaboration):\n Set a repo to teach GitHub / version control (create with long history, ask people to find who did what, and on what days) Give a project goal that required chunking down one goal into different tasks and create clues (Agile development) Create puzzles to teach reproducibility Use interesting data table to teach about dataframe and coding using pandas Use a visualization tool or shiny app to solve different puzzles  Diagrams / illustrations You can include diagrams in this section.

It’s a workaround not a solution.

Covers all domains of research.\nProblem Description of the problem you are trying to solve\nHow to encourage and ensure software maintenance gets sufficiently funded.\n_Creating software is good, but not enough: unlike research publications, which do not require maintenance, the software, to remain useful, needs to be maintained, and that requires funds. _\n_Inspired by various Concordats, e.g. The Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers (https://www.vitae.ac.uk/policy/concordat), The concordat for research integrity (https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Pages/the-concordat-for-research-integrity.aspx), we would like to introduce the idea of the Research Software Sustainability Concordat. _\nSolution Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified\n_The solution is to generate models for funding research software maintenance, then to write a white paper that is shared with funders and universities. There would be a commitment or pledge that they would sign to agree that they’d follow these principles: the Research Software Sustainability Concordat. _\nPossible models include:\n Have a public source of funding (similar to gofundme etc.) that institutions and funders could donate to and the money would be then made available to projects on application.  _Any sized project could apply, from small single-maintainer projects through to language core-developers (e.g. Python Software Foundation). _ _Application form would be very lightweight and community reviewed. _   Change the funding application form to include a section on what open-source tools will be used, and what proportion of the funding requested will be going to their maintenance (1-5% for example would go to python foundation, numpy, matplotlib). This source of funding could go straight into the plan above (instead of directly to the specific projects). In other words, this introduces a notion of Software Overheads. _Central RSE groups generate a subscription plan where projects can set aside some funding for continued maintenance, or where core funding can be set aside to support the maintenance of any software project applying to it. _ Generate awareness of the software and engage with or create a community of practitioners that can provide effort, funding or contribute to proposals to ensure the sustainability, maintenance and further development of the project. This should take into account that different projects would have different critical mass of a community, as well as different stages of the software project lyfecycle, from active development to reaching the end of shelf life.

Based on this list, creating a decision tree will help people pick their custom learning path across all these Carpentries and Carpentries-like resources.\nThe decision tree can also be used as input for a serious game or form to help people build their learning path, based on an endpoint, e.g., a specific skill set.\nAt the same time, using the decision tree will help identify gaps in the Carpentries curriculum, and can support the development of new, especially intermediate, lessons.\nLater, an AI-based recommender system can suggest useful learning paths based on inputs describing a specific research situation: “Hello System, I have this genomics dataset in JSON and want to do reproducible research on it to visualize this-and-that. I have done a Carpentries Git lesson but cannot use Python for this project, what should I learn?”\nDiagrams / Illustrations Licence These materials (unless otherwise specified) are available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Licence.

Summary:\n Guiding documents/tools for building, leading and sustaining online research communities sprouted from an event.   Context / Research Domain Please describe the context or research domain to which the problem applies\n In Brief: Support and guidance for online communities working on open research Researchers and research software engineers are rarely trained in community organisation. They may get involved in training and organising events, but they often will learn on the job on the go and rarely have access to support or guidance on current (or best) practices around community organisation. This has been a long term problem for the RSE and other communities. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown has forced many people to work from home and developing and sustaining online communities is ever more important. We want to use the experience and expertise from those activities ignited by COVID and document, to make it easier for future community organisers (researchers or RSEs) to start online communities.  Problem Description of the problem you are trying to solve\nMuch guidance and many resources exist online on how to build communities or organize events. Several are being specifically developed for online communities. However, what is sorely needed is accessible guidance to leading and sustaining online research communities that get formed organically due to online events.\nAs we continue to work from home due to the COVID-19 situation worldwide and suspect that this will continue for a foreseeable future, we have felt a need for such a guidance in our network. This is due to the fact that online events and projects can be organized without the need for expensive resources like venue, catering or travelling. This situation has created a unique and equitable opportunity for anyone with the internet to lead such an event, however many of us need skills to lead and sustain such online projects and people working on them.\nResearchers without any prior experience with project leadership would benefit from a one-stop-shop for guidance or signposts on how to lead their projects and the resulted communities. For example, there have been some efforts to address the need for leadership/management training in the RSE/data science communities (e.g RSE Aspiring Leaders workshop). However, there isn’t yet clear guidance on these topics in general and much of this training is geared towards managing/leading within hierarchical institutional structures rather than within agile cross-institutional teams.\nTo effectively and inclusively lead their projects, we want help volunteer leaders to understand and deploy tasks related to onboarding members, establishing help/guide or mentoring structure for them, rewarding their contributors, offboarding ideas so that people can leave any time (specifically to avoid burnout), reviewing/enforcing Code of Conduct, sustaining infrastructure/services, ensuring data privacy and information on project governance.\n**Solution ** A cookie-cutter-like tool to guide you through creating a community\n Either a “choose your own adventure” style guide to gamify the process An interactive tool (or similar) that takes you through each of the essential steps and provides the user with options and recommendations based on your preferences (like an expanded version of the “Choose a licence” website)  And/or\nA set of documents to capture best practice:\n We could prepare a chapter for the Project Design section of the Turing Way: see https://deploy-preview-977\u0026ndash;the-turing-way.netlify.com/project-design.html The text for the chapter could overlap with the content for the interactive tool suggested above a list of organisations (communities of practice) that can support new community organisers on their path  And/or\nMaking an interactive section to the Turing Way using Jupyter Book\nDiagrams / Illustrations\nYou can include one or two diagrams in this section.

This means the continuity of knowledge within a research group is lost.\nECRs recognise this, but people in power think it’s a timesink to encourage ECRs to pursue training in these topics. How can we get the decision makers on board? How do we get buy-in? Often evidence of impact is not enough on its own.\nWhat is needed are ways of improving group practices, that help a group lead and the members of the group. By emphasising the importance to the research group, it becomes easier to get buy-in. By making it social and communal, it helps improve group cohesion and identity.\nSolution Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified\nRunning a Dugnad in a research group A dugnad is a Norwegian term for voluntary work done as a group, where a community comes together to collaborate on communal tasks. This is often accompanied by social aspects, such as a shared meal.\nWe propose running dugnads for research groups that bring together all group members to collectively undertake important research software tasks. More experienced members might tackle important software sustainability issues, while less experienced coders can learn from observing and discussing and still help the group by performing other ‘group admin’ tasks such as writing updates for the website, testing others code and giving feedback on ease of use from a novice perspective, or try some code challenges to improve their skills.\nBenefits of running at a group level:\n Group cohesion and sharing best practice Work from students and postdocs on short term contracts can be collated into a group repository and shared with others within the group, so knowledge and code is not lost when they move institutions or leave the field. Community standards can be shared so that work can be easily transferred between people in the group, new students can hit the ground running using specialised tools rather than reinventing the wheel every time (wastes time, more error prone). Research cohesion for the lead of the group Social aspect: becoming familiar with each other’s work, not feeling isolated with an issue  The outputs from a hackathon related to this idea would be:\n A set of example dugnads (see below for potential ideas) with agendas, potential tasks, and tips for how to make it fun/social Exemplars showing how these different dugnad types could be applied to astrophysics groups and beyond the domain An engagement and communication plan that describes how successful examples of dugnads that have been run could be disseminated to the community, to persuade them to run their own (e.g. incorporating as a chapter in the Turing Way)  Things that might happen at a successful Dugnad:\n Postdoc A and PhD student B both use an old F77 simulations code. Postdoc A has some scripts to make it easier to create input files, which, motivated by B, they document and add to the group repository. New PhD student Z sits with finishing PhD student Y and learns some basic version control skills. Latest results and project ideas can be added to the University or Group webpage to advertise to potential collaborators, hires and funders. Makes the group look more active. New postdoc B has joined from a slightly different research area but quickly survey’s the group’s public webpages and creates a list of changes to request from IT. PI notices that Postdoc C could use an obscure option in the F77 monster that would make it run a bit faster, though without changing scientific results (and hence they’d never discussed it before). The PI sees how amazing sustainable software practices are, even internally, and becomes evangelical. Someone found and fixed an obscure bug in an external code. More experienced Git users can help them learn how to push that back to the main repository so the developers and wider community benefit from the fix. Everyone can bring snacks and cake! Maybe have a cheese and biscuit day or encourage celebration of diverse backgrounds by asking everyone to bring a food from their hometown. A PhD student went on a Python course and learned to use a new library for fancy interactive plotting. They give a short demonstration and help other group members try it out on their own plots. A postdoc is about to release a new code and has written documentation. Other group members can try to install and use it following their documentation and point out where they get confused or any problems that crop up on different platforms.

Emmy: Effective and equitable storytelling. Very biased by podcast i listened to this morning + panel, but apparently it only takes 500ms for people to make up their minds about an image (hence dataviz is so important). We should stop writing. But what about people who can’t see? (that’s about the end of my chain of thoughts :p)  Tool developed by Sarthak Sehgal to add CFFs: https://github.com/sarthak-sehgal/software-citation (app is down unfortunately :( )    How should we encourage researchers to use mechanisms to cite software and have their research recognised?\nSolution Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified\nCreate a set of bite-size videos to get people to cite people’s software, to get people to put a CFF file in their repos/releases - with the aim to promote increasing software citability and getting recognition for research software and RSEs\nYouTube videos.\n Why make your software citable How:  What tooling is available? What is a CFF file Creating CFF Creating codemeta.json BibTeX for software    Audience:\n Academic researcher/RSE that needs the credit to progress in their academic career  Script idea:\n Needs to be humanised: All the good stories have a real experience. Can we have a protagonist RSE that spent a lot of time on something and did not get recognition for it? Maybe this is too negative? Protagonist: researcher working very hard on their research, a major part of their work is creating software  Time is not well-invested in software because the credit is only given to academic papers - coding time is considered wasted and not recognised   Happy person in the end! Why make your software citable?  Potential recognition? Recognition for the time spent on working on their research software. Recognition for downstream dependencies should ideally be tied to recognition of the original piece of software Software must also be available for others to use - demonstrate the impact that it makes, be able to track that impact    Aim to finish a storyboard/script, even if we can’t produce these in 1-hr\n 3-min With a cartoon?  Skill sets needed:\n Artist \u0026amp; video designers a good “story developer” a narrator A Software citation expert  Scripts brainstorm\nMorane:\n“Researchers all over the world are writing papers to advance research and science, these papers are counted for credit and are the “only” way to go forward in an academic career”\n“At the same time, research is not only about writing results in papers, it is also about writing software to create or analyze results.”\n_“Time - how much time a researcher _\nEmmy:\n Protagonist: final year PhD student developing software for their research Antagonist: PI and thesis committee - “where’s your paper? Why are you spending all this time working on this software?” -\u0026gt; Stressed student, worried about their future and career, wanting to leave academia CFF comes to the rescue! WIth a CFF file, you can put in metadata about your software and allow others to easily cite your work Some collaborator of antagonist PI cited student’s software - PI is very pleased with increased impact. Protagonist is able to demonstrate that his software has been reused by 1000+ others around the world and promote CFFs and research software as proper research output to peers. Protagonist is happy.   Prototype based on Emmy’s script: https://youtu.be/6R1v1bYMhZU\nDiagrams / Illustrations You can include one or two diagrams in this section.

We’re going to focus our proof-of-concept on speech to text research.\nProblem When starting a project on a topic outside current expertise, it can be difficult and time-consuming to ascertain the current state-of-the-art in terms of tools and techniques.\nExisting literature-search methods can be blunt instruments, and may over-weight long-standing methods (that could now be superseded) or methods employed extensively by one particular successful group. They can also be very time-consuming, especially for the non-specialist (e.g. an RSE reading science publications, and vice versa).\nGoogle scholar might be doing something like this when it ranks your searches, but the approach is very unclear. It also cannot separate out the tools from the publications using them.\nSolution Create a tool for end users (non-technical/technical) to be able to search for resources related to a topic of interest to get them started on learning more about it.\nThis tool will help get some sense of what is ‘state-of-the-art’ in an area that’s outside of your expertise, using well-cited papers and well-starred/used Github repositories (weighted by factors such as recency, broadness of uptake, number of contributors etc).\nIn the hackday we can build a proof of concept which will consist of a platform where users can search a topic, and be presented with an output of top papers, tools and techniques related to this topic. For the proof of concept this topic will be speech-to-text technology and our imagined target audience will be non-technical users. (For the purposes of the hackday, the searching may not be \u0026lsquo;live\u0026rsquo;.)\nThe idea is to use data from GitHub API (starring, forking, watching, downloads, etc. stats) and Google Scholar API (eg who’s citing what/when stats) and create a score while weighting also for \u0026lsquo;newness\u0026rsquo; and any other considerations to produce the top resources and present them back to the user. We would aim to build layers on top of this including expert reviews (not for the hackday but as a next step).\nWe also want to present the \u0026lsquo;score\u0026rsquo;, in a user-friendly way, with the aim to balance including as much detail about our methodology as possible with interpretability by a non-technical audience. (Rotten Tomatoes-style presentation?)\nFinally we want to consider the possible biases and other ethical considerations of our project, for example, is it going to result in promotion of established/well known tools and papers at the expense of new/emerging/innovative ones. Consider all possible issues/biases/implications and think about how they can be mitigated, and if they cannot, does this mean this tool should not exist? Documentation is also important to this, so there will be a read.me explaining weighting rationale and contributor guidelines.\nDiagrams / Illustrations  General Notes Daniel idea:\n Look at legacy research code and figure out how wrong it is Look at metrics such as how frequently it is updated, number of bugs, how quickly they are solved, etc. Figure out whether code that research is based on is wrong, and thus whether the conclusions hold up  Jonathan idea:\n Website which gives best tools and top research papers in particular field Goal would be to give someone new to a topic and idea of the state-of-the-art Maybe have voting system as well as looking number of citations, etc. Outcomes: state of the art papers \u0026amp; how do i get started with this the quickest way possible? Distinguish marketing material vs actually best resources (maybe reviews of the paid for services) Research papers v tools? Tools - python packages or large scale? Or anything? - can split by expertise of end user? And techniques and papers? What would the proof of concept look like?  Prototype of what we would want GitHub API (starring forking watching downloads etc stats) and Google Scholar API to automate (eg who’s citing what/when stats)   Aim of proof of concept: work out level of curation burden  Keyword search for idea, and pull themes from github and papers from scholar weighted by metrics (citations, forking, starring, etc) Q: how automatable is this? What are some issues/ biases?   Jonathan: Manual curation of reference codes maybe?  What’s our USP?: This tool will help get some sense of what is ‘state-of-the-art’ in an area that’s outside of your expertise, using well-cited papers and well-starred/used github repositories.\nFor proof of concept (hackday project):\n Topic: machine learning/ neural net/ whatever Jonathan’s project was Audience: non-technical people  Output: results alongside our \u0026lsquo;notes\u0026rsquo; of why we chose them (something rotten-tomatoes style where we show our method) - report on our metric\n","permalink":"https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/cw20-state-of-the-art/","summary":"CW20 - 2020-03-31 to 2020-04-02 Idea 1 - CI1-CW20 - ‘State-of-the-Art’\nParticipants Dan Hobley\nPaddy McCann\nEmily Bell (chair)\nJonathan Frawley (scribe)\nReka Solymosi\nIain Barrass\n Context / Research Domain Meta-research: the context is a user doing a literature review for any research software project (\u0026lsquo;scientometrics\u0026rsquo;).

How can we, working remotely, maintain the communities in this mode, and make sure that the community and the people involved in it remain healthy, and productive, and have all the information and technical support they need? In open source, this sort of remote work has been common. How can we disseminate the lessons learned in these communities to research groups and teams who are experiencing remote work, collaboration, teaching for the first time?\nProblem People may never have worked with any of the available collaboration tools, and may not have seen the necessity of using them. Those that are new to these workflows and tools may find it hard to find and access the available resources. Nevertheless they will need to find answers to questions such as “Are the tools we choose to run our events accessible across all platforms?”, “Do we exclude, e.g., Windows users by picking a particular video conferencing tool?”, “We miss the sociability of the coffee breaks, how can we simulate them?”, ”Are there different opportunities we gain from being remote?”, “How can we counter the dangers of being in a remote event, e.g., doing multiple things at once instead of just ‘being at the conference’?”\nSolution We describe considerations, workflows and tools for running remote activities for people that need to facilitate such an event but don’t have any previous experience. We would also like to capture things about CW20 that worked well for running future online conferences. In the course, we will describe which tools and features work well for which purpose, and other features (e.g., pricing, necessity to download, open/closed source). We also suggest solutions for more general issues, such as scheduling, and work modes suitable for online conferences (e.g., set your away message to be able to concentrate on the online event).\nOutcomeA subsection of a Turing Way chapter on running collaborative online events which describes the use case of running an online event with different requirements.\nStructure:\n Activity types / Use cases (Mix and match these to build your online event!) \\   workshop \\ hack event \\ poster session \\ prototyping/ideas session \\ presentations (including lightning talks) \\ pre-recorded presentations \\ panel sessions \\ async collaboration on a text \\ Tools for pair-programming  Requirements \\   breakout rooms \\ chat \\ video/audio (where can these be tested?) \\ VCS integration \\ live streaming \\ whiteboard \\ Recording tools for pre-recorded talks 1.

In healthcare there is a similar discipline in public and patient involvement. However, there are no equivalent tools or widespread training in the usability of apps and websites, so software designed to collect data from non-specialists does not always work as intended and sometimes introduces unexpected bias. This can be a major issue in studies relying on citizen science or self-reported healthcare measures, for example.\nSolution Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified\nThree overlapping parts to the solution:\n Resources: Create a resource of common design principles that can be published. Could be a chapter in The Turing Way, or a Carpentries-style workshop (or both).

Several training programmes exist online, however these may not be easily accessible or in formats that can be utilised.\nProblem Description of the problem you are trying to solve\nSoftware and data carpentries courses provide training in fundamental data skills essential to conducting research. Training researchers in these data skills is an essential part of empowering researchers in LMICs. However, delivering these courses depends on reliable internet access. That means that individuals who are living in areas with unreliable internet access, quite literally cannot access this valuable training.\nSolution Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified\nCreate an infrastructure using raspberry pis to deliver software and data carpentries offline and in remote areas. The idea is that a trainer could carry the devices to the training location, use keyboards/mice/displays that are already there, and easily set up a network that contains all the training materials, with no need for external internet access.\nThe materials would all be available on GitHub and licensed so that anyone could take the materials, set up their own network of Raspberry Pis, and deliver the Carpentries training courses.\nThe work could be broken down as follows:\n Identify components/overall structure of PI network, for example:  wifi access point - If access is possible, a mobile network APN can be used. If not a Raspberry Pi access point (eb. RaspAP) can be used to network several Pis. git server (gitlab/github?) - A server (on a Pi) to mimic access to GitHub and avoid the need for Internet access learning materials server - A server (on a Pi) with all necessary downloads and learning materials Workstations - Raspberry Pis to serve as workstations.   Identify and document the minimum hardware requirements. Create images to write to SD cards of Pis. Create ‘Train the trainer’-type materials: 5. How to set up Pi network. 6. How to run course. Create admin system for planning and running workshops: Organising workshops can be quite time consuming having to keep track of registrations, instructors, helpers, sending emails etc. Although specified within the scope of this proposal the system should be usable to any workshop organiser (online and offline). This work package is potentially a project on its own but should include at least the following: 7. An offline program (that could potentially synchronise with an online system) 8. Register an online workshop 9. Registration of learners 10. Keeping track of potential helpers and helpers allocated to a specified workshop 11. Keeping track of potential instructors and instructors allocated to a specified workshop 12. Keeping track of available hardware resources (how many Pis and what is installed on them) 13. Sending emails automatically to learners, instructors and helpers. 14. (This is the very beginning of a functional requirements document which will probably take up a lot of time and space!)
